# Berlin Traffic Accidents 2018-2020
### Final Project @ IronHack (Data Analytics Bootcamp, Jan-Mar 2022)
### by Selena Eberwein & Roman Kaltschew

Using the datasets provided by [BerlinOpenData](https://daten.berlin.de/kategorie/verkehr) we take a look at the accidents involving physical injuries (type of accident, kind of injury, road/lighting condition), use the geographical data provided to highlight areas with a high number of accidents and show the impact of the lockdowns in 2020 on accident numbers.<br>
We also include the accident statitistics provided by [Polizei Berlin](https://www.berlin.de/polizei/aufgaben/verkehrssicherheit/verkehrsunfallstatistik/) and [statistik Berlin-Brandenburg](https://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/strassenverkehr) to get a general overview on all accidents (including only damage to property). Moreover the historical weather data provided by the [website of wetterkontor](https://wetterkontor.de/) will be added as features.<br>
As we can see the amount of accidents by cyclists increased during the lockdowns (absolute and relative), we will build a model to show the main causes of accidents and have a look on the actions taken by the government of Berlin to imporve safety.
